<h2 class="work-title page-header-text-dark">Robert Mischuda</h2>



I’m a **Senior Product Designer** born and raised in Berlin with **15+ years of experience** in B2B, B2C, and AI startups.

I combine design, usability, and business goals to craft products that are both functional and visually appealing — from research to final delivery.

### Background & Versatility

Before focusing on product design, I worked as an **Illustrator, 2D & 3D Artist**, and was even a **Frontend Developer**. This unique mix of visual craft and technical understanding allows me to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and production-ready implementation.

    <span class="image-caption">I also try to bring fun into work — I’ve even created pixel art of all our team members for our weekly team meetings! 🙂</span>

### Why I do what I do

I believe that even the most complex enterprise tools deserve to be intuitive and delightful. Whether I'm leading stakeholder workshops, building design systems, or creating high-fidelity prototypes, my goal is always the same: **Design for trust and impact.**
