<h2>Digitizing a Traditional Industry: The Thermondo Story</h2>
</div>

Thermondo was growing at an explosive rate, expanding by 650 percent in just two years. They were trying to bring the traditional heating market into the digital age, but their web presence couldn't keep up with the complexity. The site was struggling to convert visitors into leads, and the sheer amount of new content made the navigation messy.

<h2>Structuring the Chaos</h2>
</div>

My first priority was to bring order to the platform. The marketing team needed to create new pages constantly, but they were blocked by a reliance on developers. I designed a modular system with standardized margins and reusable elements. This allowed the content team to build varied, professional layouts on their own without breaking the design system or "reinventing the wheel" for every page.

To handle the growing library of information, I mapped out entirely new user flows and sitemaps. I learned early on that abstract discussions often led to stalled decisions, especially with skeptical stakeholders. I overcame this by producing detailed wireframes for every single screen and state. This visual rigor helped me win over difficult partners by showing them exactly how the logic would work before we wrote a single line of code.

<h2>The 52% Uplift</h2>
</div>

The most critical part of the project was the "Multistep Calculator," the main engine for generating sales leads. The existing version was a conversion killer. It was cluttered with distracting elements, stock photography that eroded trust, and a confusing progress bar that made the process feel endless. It also completely failed on mobile devices.

    <span class="image-caption">The legacy calculator suffered from high cognitive load and visual misalignment.</span>
</div>

I redesigned the experience from the ground up with a focus on "Radical Focus." I stripped away everything that didn't help the user answer the next question. We replaced generic stock photos with images of real Thermondo installers to build trust. I simplified the navigation into four clear steps so users could always see the finish line.

<h2>The Result</h2>
</div>

We didn't just make it look better; we proved that good design drives revenue. We A/B tested the new calculator against the old one, and the results were undeniable. The new design generated 52 percent more leads. It was the company's biggest UX achievement of the year, proving that simplifying a complex form into a clean, mobile-responsive experience was the key to unlocking growth.
