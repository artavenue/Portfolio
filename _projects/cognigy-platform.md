<h2>The Challenge</h2>
</div>

Cognigy is a powerful platform, but after years of rapid feature growth, the UI had become fragmented. Different teams built features using different patterns, leading to inconsistent experiences and high technical debt.

My challenge was to **stop the entropy**—to introduce a shared design language and architecture that would allow the product to scale for the next 5 years without breaking.

<h2>Establishing a Design Standard</h2>
</div>

I championed and established **Shadcn** as the new component standard across the entire product. This wasn't just a visual refresh; it was a fundamental shift in how design and engineering collaborated.

### Key Improvements

- **Component Library:** I audited and consolidated 40+ disparate UI components into a consistent, accessible set.
- **Shared Vocabulary:** "Button" now meant the same thing to a designer in Figma and a developer in React.
- **Accessibility First:** The new system baked in WCAG compliance, making the platform accessible to enterprise standards out of the box.

<h2>Navigation & Onboarding</h2>
</div>

Enterprise software often suffers from "menu bloat." I restructured the information architecture to reflect user workflows, not database structures.

- **Context-Aware Navigation:** Reduced visual noise by showing only relevant tools for the current task.
- **Progressive Onboarding:** Designed a "Getting Started" checklist that guides new users through their first bot build, replacing a 50-page PDF manual.

<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div>

- ☑️ **Engineering Velocity:** The new component system reduced UI-related bugs by ~40% and sped up frontend implementation.
- ☑️ **Unified Brand:** The platform finally looks like one cohesive product, not a collection of features.
- ☑️ **Scalability:** The new architecture successfully accommodated 3 major new product lines launched in the following year.
